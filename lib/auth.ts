/**
 * Verifies the bearer token against MCP_BEARER_TOKEN.
 *
 * This is the resource-server side check. The token itself can arrive
 * either as a static header (if a client supports that) or as the
 * access_token minted by our own minimal OAuth authorization server (see
 * lib/oauth.ts) — either way it's the same MCP_BEARER_TOKEN value, so this
 * check doesn't need to know which path the caller took.
 *
 * Every failed check is logged (always) and, if SECURITY_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL
 * is set, POSTed to that webhook (best-effort) — see lib/securityAlert.ts.
 * This is the only place that gates every tool call, so it's the one spot
 * where logging failed attempts gives real visibility into whether this
 * server's bearer token has leaked and is being probed.
